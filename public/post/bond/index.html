<p>Year 2018 has not been a good one for the bond investors. Since the summer of 2017, interest rates have been rising.</p>
<p>The long term interest rates had been trending lower since 1980s. In the chart above rates reached a high of 8% and since then they kept making lower lows. Currently the ten year rates are near the an important key level at 3%. From here the future path interest will decide which way the trend moves. Do we break out of the 3% resistance level? or do we fade back lower? It will be interesting to see.</p>
<p>Below are the bond performance for different maturities. Even though the rates were trending lower, there were a few years when bonds suffered negative returns. Similarly it is possible that even if interest rates trend higher, we could get some years where bonds give positive returns.</p>
