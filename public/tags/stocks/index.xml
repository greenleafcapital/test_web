      <description>A potential trade idea that we executed today was being long Gold. First lets see how the shiny object has performed since 2010 versus the dollar.
Its clear from the chart that both assets move in opposite directions (most of the time). After the huge run in price in Gold from 2009 t0 2013, it saw a crash in 2014. Since then its been sideways and range bound trading between $1300 to $1200.</description>

      <description>FAANG stock performance since July 1, 2018
With Netflix and Facebook both suffering major losses, all eyes will be on Apple as it races to be the first company with a $1 Trillion valuation.
How have the FAANG stocks performed YTD
Netflix and Amazon have clearly dominated the large cap stocks. This has been a terrible year of performance for managers who make a living by shorting “bubble basket stocks”.</description>

      <description>Yesterday Facebook reported their earnings after market hours and investors were not pleased. They sent the stock down almost 25% at one point. Right now the stock is down about 20%. We wanted to check if this was the worst performance for Facebook stock since the IPO
This is the worst one day performance for Facebook since its IPO. After its IPO Facebook stock was under heavy pressure and it continued to slide down for several days.</description>
