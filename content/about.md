This website was built to log financial events, portfolio strategies and trading ideas. This website is not intended to provide financial advice. Financial assets such as company stocks are risky. They can depreciate in value and cause permanent loss of capital. It is always important to consult a financial advisor to discuss whether a certain investment is suitable for you. 

If you would like to learn, then a fake money account is more appropriate for learning. There are several websites that offer such services.
